# template-js-rethinkdb-mocked

Database mocking used by template projects. Using this package [requires extensive boilerplate.][0]

This package (currently) provides a drop-in replacement for 'thinkyMock' and 'rethinkMock' files found in venom-api and the template application.

If you are updating this package, please try to add one or two tests and remove a few boilerplate requirements :).
