# template-js-rethinkdb-mocked

Database mocking used by template projects. Using this package [requires extensive boilerplate.][0]

**Version 0.1.2** provides drop-in replacement for 'thinkyMock' and 'rethinkMock' files found in venom-api and the template application.

**Version 0.2.0** removes some boilerplate required by 0.1.2 and may have backwards-compatibility issues. Changes here are used by the social-profile application.


------------------
If you are updating this package, please try to add one or two tests and remove a few boilerplate requirements :).
